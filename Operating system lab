# 1. Become superuser (needed to create folder in /)
sudo -i

# 2. Create directory /test
mkdir /test

# 3. Make it public (everyone can read, write, execute)
chmod 777 /test

# 4. Create file “testfile.txt” inside /test
touch /test/testfile.txt

# 5. Change permissions: only owner can read, nobody else can write
chmod 400 /test/testfile.txt   # (r-------- for owner)

# 6. Create another user “usama”
adduser usama      # follow the prompts to set password etc.

# 7. Switch to user usama
su - usama

# 8. Try to read the file (this should fail)
cat /test/testfile.txt

# 9. Exit back to ubuntu user
exit

# 10. Change permission so everyone can read, write, execute
chmod 777 /test/testfile.txt

# 11. Switch to usama again
su - usama

# 12. Now read the file (this should work)
cat /test/testfile.txt

# 13. Exit back
exit
